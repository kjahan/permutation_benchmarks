General description: Here, we compare performance of different programming languages by generating string ermutations.

Contributors: Kazem Jahanbakhsh, Phil Hilger, Tom Chung

Technical details:
We compare different languages from performance point of view. As a starting point, we choose a simple task (generating all permutations of an input string). We compare four different languages: PhP, Python, Golang, and C++. Below you can find the recursive implementations for generating all permutations in different languages. We tested each language by passing a string with length of 11.

Performance results (in sec): PhP 20, Python 15.72, Golang 9.2, and C++ 1.5!
